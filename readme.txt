Shows a list of all current cookies on your site, both for admins and visitors (optional). 

== Description ==

Show Me The Cookies displays all current cookies your site is using. Once activated, you can find this list under Appearance - Cookies.

Furthermore you can display this list to your visitors by placing the shortcode [cookies] into any post or page. 

WordPress uses several cookies under the hood by default. If you'd like to filter these out, you can use the shortcode [cookies-nowp]. If you like, you can replace the default separator between the cookie name and its value by adding your own string between the opening and closing shortcode tags, for example [cookies] ==> [\cookies]. 

This plugin is based on code by David Artiss, who kindly made it available on GitHub. I've wrapped it up into this standalone plugin.
